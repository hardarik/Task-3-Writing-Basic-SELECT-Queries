SQL Task: Writing Basic SELECT Queries
Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental SQL querying skills as part of my internship task focused on extracting data from one or more tables using SELECT statements. The purpose of this exercise is to gain hands-on experience with core SQL concepts such as filtering, projection, sorting, and limiting results. The project uses MySQL Workbench as the primary tool to write, test, and run SQL queries on a sample database.

Project Scope and Objectives
The key objective is to become proficient in retrieving meaningful data by crafting various SELECT queries, employing clauses and conditions including:

Retrieving all columns or specific columns from a table.
Filtering records based on multiple conditions using WHERE, AND, OR.
Pattern matching using LIKE.
Selecting ranges using BETWEEN.
Sorting the result set using ORDER BY.
Limiting the number of records returned with LIMIT.
Performing basic JOIN operations to combine data from related tables.
These skills are foundational for any SQL developer and critical for handling real-world database queries effectively.

Tools and Environment
Database: MySQL 8.0 (or compatible version)
Query Tool: MySQL Workbench
Operating System: Windows / macOS / Linux (any platform supported by MySQL Workbench)
Repository Platform: GitHub
Database Schema
Two tables were created to simulate a simple employee management system:

departments

dept_id (INT): Primary key identifying the department.
dept_name (VARCHAR): Name of the department.
employees

emp_id (INT): Primary key for each employee.
first_name (VARCHAR): Employee’s first name.
last_name (VARCHAR): Employee’s last name.
dept_id (INT): Foreign key referencing the employee’s department.
salary (DECIMAL): Employee’s salary.
hire_date (DATE): Date when the employee was hired.
Sample Data
Sample records were inserted to represent different departments and employees with varied attributes such as salary and hire date, enabling meaningful query examples for filtering and sorting.
